                    <div class="contentA">My running adventure started when I was in primary school. I was always choosen by teachers to take part in different running competition. I didn’t really enjoy it, because I had never been fast enought to win.<br> When I was 15 I started to run on my own and I discovered I’m really into it. Since then I’ve started to run distances around 10km for pleasure and to calm myself down.<br> Recently I came back to take part in running competitions. I’ve taken part in some 5km and 10km races and 6km Survival Race. My 10km best time on certified route is 56:25 (from 27. Bieg Powstania Warszawskiego), not best one, but I’m begginer in racing. I’m going to run a half marathon soon.
                           <br> I live in Wrocław and I usually do my trainings there. I often run on the river and in the photo there is one of the routes I’ve run.</div>
